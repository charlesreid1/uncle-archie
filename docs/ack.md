Uncle Archie the home-brewed CI server is implemented
in [Python](https://python.org)
using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
to provide a front-end web server and
[PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
to interact with the Github API.

Uncle Archie is based largely on 
[Captain Hook](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/b-captain-hook/),
which is itself inspired by and forked from
[carlos-jenkins/python-github-webhooks](https://github.com/carlos-jenkins/python-github-webhooks)
on Github.
