# uncle-jenkins

**Uncle Jenkins** is a homebrew continuous integration server.
It handles pull request checks (build-test) and push-to-deploy 
functionality (build-test-deploy).

Uncle Jenkins is intended to run behind an nginx reverse proxy
so that SSL can be used. This requires the server running 
Uncle Jenkins be accessible at a domain name, and not just be
a bare IP address.
