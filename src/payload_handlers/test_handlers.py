Define Payload Handlers for Tests

This file defines Uncle Archie payload handlers
for testing purposes. These payload handlers
mainly test information extraction functionality,
so most of the Tasks run by these test Payload
Handlers will just be extracting bits of info
and logging them. The test will then check the
logs to verify the correct information was extracted.
